# Abstract {-}

## Aim {-}

New Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) technology provides accurate and validated
point-of-care creatinine measurement. Such technology makes it possible to
detect small, short-term increases in creatinine levels. These changes alone
however lack clinical context. We aimed to improve the predictive value of
small, short-term creatinine increases for the development of Acute Kidney
Injury (AKI) in critically ill patients by incorporating clinically available
information.

## Methods {-}

In this prospective cohort study, we assessed all the creatinine values from
ABGs and laboratory biochemistry results in critically ill patients. We
calculated the small, short-term creatinine increases between creatinine values
during the patient’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission until the development
of KDIGO-defined AKI or ICU discharge or death, whichever occurred first. We
evaluated the predictive value of these creatinine increases over varying time
periods for AKI development in multivariable analysis with known risk factors,
co-morbidities and other clinically available data.

## Results {-}

**TO BE FIXED UP**

We screened a convenience sample of 830 patients and excluded 443 (53.4%)
patients [AKI on admission (208; 47%), weekend admission (91; 21%) and other
pre-defined exclusion criteria (144; 32%)]. The 387 (46.6%) eligible patients
had 3,974 creatinine measurements on ABGs and biochemistry results, which
generated 71,499 creatinine change episodes, excluding creatinine measurements
after AKI development. In multivariable modelling, creatinine increases of
≥1 µmol/L/h over 6 to 7 hours had an odds ratio of 3.14 (95% CI 1.82 – 5.43) for
the development of AKI in 8 to 16 hours after the creatinine increase. The
multivariable model with these creatinine increases had an 81.5% sensitivity,
74.2% specificity and 0.85 area under the curve for AKI development in 8 to 16
hours.

## Conclusion {-}

In combination with known risk factors, frequent creatinine assessment to detect
small, short-term creatinine increases provides a novel and rapid method of
predicting AKI in critically ill patients.

# Introduction

[1/2 Page Approx]

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically-ill patients
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and is associated
with high morbidity and mortality in the critically ill
population. Its pathogenesis is still poorly understood,
with limited ability to predict its occurrence. Failure to
improve outcomes of patients with AKI may be linked to
delays in its detection.

* Creatinine changes alone lack context. In order to improve predictability of
Cr from ABG likely obtaining readily clinically available info will improve the
ability of serum cr to predict subsequent AKI.

* Assessment of small short term cr changes have limited predictive value

* Aim to develop a model that uses short term changes in serum cr and clinical
info to improve predictive values

* High performing model can be developed when taking clinical characteristics as
well as short term cr changes for acute kidney injury

# Methods

## Design and Setting

* This single-centre prospective observational study received ethics
approval with a waiver for consent from the Austin Health and Monash
University Human Research Ethics Committees.

## Study Cohort

* We screened all patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre ICU
between 5 February and 16 July 2018 for enrolment. Exclusion criteria
were age b 18 years, AKI (as per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes
[KDIGO] definition) on ICU admission, end-stage kidney disease,
kidney transplant, weekend admission, end-of-life care and no urinary
catheter nor arterial line in situ.

* In total there were 8,817 ABG and Bio Chem Cr measurements which corresponds
to 251,652 Cr change episodes. Of these creatinine change episodes, 43,404 were
in admissions that did not have AKI and 28,095 change episodes were before onset
of AKI. There were 180,153 Cr change episodes after the onset of AKI and these
were discarded.

## Variables and Definitions

* AKI Outcome: Patients who developed an episode of creatinine increase were
monitored for AKI until ICU discharge. AKI was defined and classified by both
the urinary output and creatinine KDIGO criteria

* Creatinine definition

* Co-morbidities

## Statistical Analysis

* Analysed the data using R software 4.0.2 and packages tidyverse version 1.3.0,
cutpointr version 1.0.32 and optimr version 2019-12.16.

* To assess predictive performance, we computed the area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve
for the detection of the primary outcome. AUROC quality
was defined as follows: excellent (0.9–1.0), very good (0.8
to < 0.9), good (0.7 to < 0.8), fair (0.6 to < 0.7), poor (0.5
to < 0.6), and invaluable (< 0.5).

* Used Youden's index to derive optimal cut-points to calculate diagnostic
characteristics with 95% CIs.

## Optimal univariable Cr ch model

* Cr ch only model (based on binary variable cr ch gradient > 1 µmol/L/h)
* Varied duration of cr_ch and time to aki, optimising for AUROC
* Compared to previous models, this has a better AUROC but is still not great

```{r optim_cr_ch_only}
set.seed(8)
optim_in = rbind(
  c(6.0, 1.0, 8.0, 10 ), # Baseline
  c(6.0, 2.1, 8.1, 4.3), # AUC 0.6451
  c(6.6, 2.5, 8.0, 4.0), # AUC 0.6637
  c(6.7, 1.2, 8.1, 9.6), # AUC 0.6396
  cbind(
    runif(20, 6, 7),

    runif(20, 7.5, 8.5),
    runif(20, 4, 5)
  ),
  cbind(
    runif(50, 3, 10),
    runif(50, 1, 3),
    runif(50, 8, 12),
    runif(50, 3, 48)
  )
)
heuristic_calc <- function(AUC, per_admin_in){return(AUC)}
optim_only_model <- aki_optim_wrapper(
  optim_in,
  outcome_var = "AKI_ICU",
  add_gradient_predictor = 1
)
kable(head(optim_only_model$optim_summary, 20))
```

* Below is the model with maximum AUROC

```{r optim_cr_ch_only_model}
only_model <- aki_dev_wrapper(
  outcome_var = "AKI_ICU",
  baseline_predictors = "",
  cr_predictors = NULL,
  del_t_ch_hr_range = c(5.33, 7.25),
  del_t_aki_hr_range = c(8, 12.66),
  add_gradient_predictor = 1,
  all_data = TRUE,
  analysis_data = analysis_df
)
kable(only_model$params)
kable(publish(only_model$model, print = FALSE, digits = c(2, 3))$regressionTable,
      align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'))
kable(summarise_cutpoint(only_model), align = c('l', 'r'))
```

## Known risk factors

* Includes all collected risk factors and comorbidities
* Note that not all of the risk factors are statistically significant
* The AUROC of this model is ok
